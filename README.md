# 📊 DataScout – Automated Data Analysis & AI Insight Platform

DataScout is a web-based platform that automates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and provides **intelligent insights** from data using AI technologies like Gemini or GPT. Designed especially for freelancers, analysts, and small-to-medium businesses, the system offers customizable, interactive data exploration without manual effort.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- 🧠 Automatically load and clean datasets from various sources (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL).
- 📊 Perform structured and modular Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- 📈 Generate meaningful visuals, summaries, and feature statistics.
- 🤖 Use AI (Gemini/OpenAI) to suggest insights, patterns, and business strategies.
- 🧾 Create downloadable and interactive reports for stakeholders.
- 🌐 Web-based UI to let users select what analysis or insights they want.

## 🔧 Core Features

- ✅ Upload datasets through a sleek frontend.
- ✅ Automatically preprocess and validate data.
- ✅ Choose between standard EDA tasks (summary stats, visuals, correlations).
- ✅ Get AI-powered suggestions for trends, insights, and possible business decisions.
- ✅ Download reports (PDF/HTML) for business use or presentations.

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified)

1. **User Uploads Data**
   - CSV/Excel file is uploaded through the UI.
2. **Backend Loads and Preprocesses**
   - Cleans missing data, converts types, logs shapes, formats.
3. **User Selects EDA Options**
   - Summary statistics? Visuals? Feature selection?
4. **AI Option**
   - User asks for insights — Gemini or OpenAI returns suggestions like:
     - "High churn rate in region X"
     - "Consider creating a discount feature"
5. **Report Generation**
   - PDF/HTML report can be downloaded from UI.
